                <p>Hi, Im Katherine. I am a UX/UI designer.  Born in Caracas, Venezuela, raised in Atlanta, Ga. I am observant, calm and dedicated . I believe design should be purposeful and invite users in, while keeping it relevant to its original intent. </p>

            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <p>I learned UX/UI design through a Georgia Tech Bootcamp in Atlanta, Ga. I have always loved design and even started a streetwear clothing company in high school. I mostly have a history in customer service in the food industry. My organization and focus has resulted in moving up in multiple work experiences. I like being passionate about what I’m doing and I think that shows in my results. 

                I have worked on projects focused on user research, wireframing & UI design. When creating designs, I constantly refer back to my user research to make sure the intent of my design is in tact.
                
                Outside of UX, there’s a few things I enjoy. This includes coffee, cooking, music, traveling, conventions & museums. If I’m traveling I definitely try to find a good coffee shop in the area.  I’m a big fan of going to live shows and try to attend any show a band/musician I like is having in my area. I have gone to the extent of going across state lines for some of my favorite musicians.</p>
